# Notes-on-TDD

A little git repo to hold my goto if I need a refresher on TDD.

# Specification vs Verification.

Think **Specification** rather than **Verification***

***Specification:*** Defines what the feature should do.
## Example
When the user does not enter a quantity of the product, an error message is shown.

***Verification:*** Write the code to satisfy the specificaiton.
## Example
The user can enter the quantity of the product.

# Specification template

**Scenario:** When the user does not enter a quantity of the product, then click next
  **1. Expectation:** an error message is shown.

**Scenario:** When the user enters a valid quantity of a product, then click next
  **1.Expectation:** the user's payment page is shown.
